# Perspective-Transformation-using-Deep-Learning
Performing perspective transformations on images using a deep learning model. The goal is to warp an input image to match a target perspective, which is particularly useful in applications like image stitching, augmented reality, and camera calibration. The project uses a custom ResNet-18 architecture to predict the transformation matrix .
